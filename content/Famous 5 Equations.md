The only condition is: **Acceleration must be constant**
You would have to use calculus if acceleration is changing

# Delta
$\triangle A = A_{final} - A_{initial}$
# Equation 1:
$v_{avg} = \frac{v_1+v_2}{2}$
$v_{avg} = \frac{\triangle d}{\triangle t}$
$\triangle d = (\frac{v_1+v_2}{2})(\triangle t)$
# Equation 2:
$a = \frac{\triangle v}{\triangle t}$
$v_{2} = v_{1} + a(\triangle t)$
# Equation 3:
$\triangle d = (v)(t) + \frac{1}{2}(a)(t^2)$
derived from subbing in equation 2 into equation 1.
# Equation 4:
$\triangle d = v_2(\triangle t) - \frac{1}{2}(a)(t^2)$
# Equation 5:
$v_2^2 = v_1^2 + 2a(\triangle d)$
