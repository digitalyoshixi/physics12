# $g$ - Gravitational Constant
Galileo dropped 2 bodies at the same height and found their acceleration is the same.

$g = 9.8[DOWN]m/s^2$

Depending on the use-case, this value may be used as a scalar.
# Key Concepts
- An object thrown downwards or upwards will always hit the ground faster than if an object was dropped from rest
- An object thrown downwards will hit the ground with the same velocity as if it were thrown upwards with the same magnitude
