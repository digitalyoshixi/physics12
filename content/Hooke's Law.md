An empirical law which states that the deformation (x) of an elastic object is [[Direct Relationship|Directly Proportional]] to the applied force ($F_{a}$)
$$F_{a}=kx$$
$$\overrightarrow a = \frac{kx}{m}$$
This simply means that more force will deform the object more. And no force, means no deformities
