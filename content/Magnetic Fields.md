# Magnetism
Very few materials are actually magnetic:
- Iron
- Neodymium
- Bismuth
On their own, they do not make magnets. Particles that form together and make a domain. When you point the particles in a certain direction, the domain is a magnetic field.
# Magnetic Fields
When you have a magnet, the magnetic field is created by putting test magnets which are compasses and mapping which direction they point
