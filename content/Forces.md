A presence that changes how things move.
# Contact Forces
Commonly push or pull.
- [[Friction]]
- [[Tension]]
- [[Drag Force]]
- [[Normal Force]]
# Non-Contact Forces
- [[Gravity]]

# Net Force [[Newton's 2nd Law]]
Net force is the total force vector of where the object is headed
$$F_{net} = ma$$
$$F_{net} = \sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}_{[Direction^o]}$$
For an object to have constant velocity, $a = 0$, which means $F_{net} = 0$
