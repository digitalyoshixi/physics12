# Escaping Orbits
An orbit is escaped whenever the [[Binding Energy]] retaining the orbit is surpassed.

Planets forever exert a gravitational force regardless of distance. We know this because the relation between $F_{g}$ and $r$ is an [[Inverse Square]] relationship.

For an object to 'escape' earth's orbit, the object must reach infinity.

### Escape Velocity
$$v_{esc}=\sqrt{2}v_{orbit}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$
# Formula
If an object is in orbit, then the [[Binding Energy]] to escape orbit is:
$E_{binding} = |E_{orbit}|$
