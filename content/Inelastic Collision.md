# Inelastic Collisions
- When you deform a paper, the shape changes as the energy is dissipated into heat.
- Rocks don't break, very little energy is lost from the collision. Hard objects hitting each other should not deform. You're also not losing kinetic energy
# Energy Lost After Collision
$\triangle E_{k} = (\frac{1}{2})(m_{1})(v_{1}^2)(1-\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})$
