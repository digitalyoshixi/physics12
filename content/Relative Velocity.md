# $_{a}v_{b}$ Relative Velocity
The velocity of object $a$ **relative** to another object or observer **b**
### $_{a}v_{b} = \ _{a}v_{g} - \ _{b}v_{g}$
As we set the [[Inertial Reference Frame]] from the **ground** to reference object
Since, both velocities $_{a}v_{g}$ and $_{b}v_{g}$ have reference points on the ground, the difference is the velocity between the 2 objects
### $_{a}v_{b} = -_bv_{a}$
When you view the same 2 objects from the opposite perspectives.
For example, a car moves 100m/s when earth is the reference point.
If you changed your perspective to be in the car, then instead the earth would appear to be moving 100m/s around you and in the opposite direction.

### $_{b}v_{g} = \ _bv_{a} + \ _av_{g}$
Since, the middle letters 'a' are the same, you can combine the 2.
Derived from the first law $_{a}v_{b} = \ _{a}v_{g} - \ _{b}v_{g}$
