# Young's Modulus
Measure of how stiff a material is
$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = \frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}}$
Found by stretching a material one direction until it breaks, then recording the stress and strain, then finding the rate of change between the 2.

Spring constant can be obtained from young's modulus.
$k = E \frac{A}{L}$
