We in Canada will experience summer when the point is angled towards the sun
When the axis is angled away from the sun,

Kepler's second law states that the time intervals - say July-May, and another time interval Jan - Nov have the same area.

Since, they have the same area, the orbit of the earth is fastest in the months of ~Nov-Jan.
