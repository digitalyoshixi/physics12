# UCM
An object undergoing uniform circular motion means it is moving in a circular motion with a constant velocity.

# Assumptions
- $\overrightarrow v$ is constant
- $\overrightarrow a_{c} \neq 0$
	- Acceleration is moving towards the center, so instantaneous velocity is not changing
# Formulas
### Acceleration
$$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$a = 4\pi^2rf^2$$
$$a = \frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$
