# Relative Motion
As everything in our universe is moving all at once, it would be illogical to assume such a concept as absolute motion.
Everything in the world must be measured in relation to a reference point.

In relative motion, motion of an object is captured from a [[Inertial Reference Frame]], which is a object we pretend is completely still

# Concepts
- [[Fictitious Force]]
- [[Inertial Reference Frame]]
- [[Relative Velocity]]
	- [[Wind]]
	- [[Currents]]
# Relative Velocity Subscripts
$_{o}\overrightarrow v_{g}$ : velocity of **object** relative to **ground**
$_{m}\overrightarrow v_{g}$ : velocity of the **medium** an object is in relative to **ground**
$_{o}\overrightarrow v_{m}$ : velocity of the **object** relative to the **medium**

$_{o}\overrightarrow v_{g}$ = $_{o}\overrightarrow v_{m}$ + $_{m}\overrightarrow v_{g}$. Explanation: [[Subscript Conventions]]
