# Linear Momentum

### Formula
$$\overrightarrow p = m \overrightarrow v$$
### SI Units
$\frac{kgm}{s}$
# Conservation of Linear Momentum
Following the [[Conservation of Energy]],
The total momentum of a system remains constant in all points of time if and only if:
- No external unbalanced forces are acting on the objects
This means that:

### Momentum Collision
2+ Objects in collision
- Total initial [[Linear Momentum|Momentum]] = Total final [[Linear Momentum|Momentum]]
- Total [[Impulse]] = 0
##### Formulas
$$p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}+\dots = p_{1}'+p_{2}'+p_{3}'+\dots$$

# Recoil
Recoil as a concept exists because the momentum before shot must equal the momentum after shot.

So when a object has forward momentum, it must be counteracted somehow. The gun gains backwards momentum as a result.
