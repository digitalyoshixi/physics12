# Escaping Orbits
For an object to escape earth's orbit, the object must reach infinity. 

For sake of argument, if we threw an object with just enough speed to stop at infinity,
Since it is at infinity: $E_{G} = 0$
Since it stops at infinity: $E_{k} = 0$
Thus $E_{T} = 0$
For an object to escape earth's orbit, it must have a $E_{T}\geq 0$
# Formula
If an object is in orbit, then the binding energy to escape orbit is:
$E_{binding} = |E_{orbit}|$
