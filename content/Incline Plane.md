# Incline Force
When you go down a ramp, you end up accelerating down the hill. Gravity is moving you at an angle. 
### Gravity On Incline Planes
use [[2D Vector Components]] to change $F_g$

We need to convert this downwards vector into 2 vectors that are parallel & perpendicular to our box

In this case, you can make conventions at an angle to make life easier to calculate.

# Key Concepts
- $\overrightarrow a = g\sin \theta$
- $F_{Norm} = g\cos \theta$
- $0\leq\theta\leq90$
# $\mu$ Coefficient Of Friction
It is found that 
$$\mu = \tan \theta$$
