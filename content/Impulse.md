# Impulse
Impulse is when a force is applied, changing the acceleration, which changes the velocity, which changes the momentum. 
### Formulas
$$\overrightarrow J = \triangle \overrightarrow p = \overrightarrow p_{final} - \overrightarrow p_{initial}$$
$$\overrightarrow J = F_{net}(\triangle t)$$
### SI Units
- $Ns$ newton seconds
- $\frac{kgm}{s}$ 

# Softened Impact
### Egg
A egg breaks on the ground, but an egg on a sheet does not break because, the force is applied over a longer period.
$\overrightarrow J$  is constant.
$\triangle t$ increases $\uparrow$
thus, $\overrightarrow F$ decreases $\downarrow$
### Car collisions
A collision softened on many fronts
- Front of car crumbles so people are slowed down
- Helmets reduce average force on the head. Increases time for head to come to stop
- Airbag provides small force to slow you down, applied over a longer time
