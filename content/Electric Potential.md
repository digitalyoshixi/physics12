# $V$ Electric Potential 
The amount of energy each coulomb of charge has at a certain point.
Not very useful on its own, its best to find the [[Electric Potential Difference]] instead
### SI Unit
$\frac{J}{C}$
[[Energy|Joules]] per [[Coulomb]]
# Formula
$$V=\frac{kq}{\triangle d}$$
- $k$ is [[Coulomb|Coulomb's Constant]]
- $q$ is Charge of the origin particle
$$V=\frac{E_{e}}{q}$$
- $E_{e}$ is [[Electric Potential Energy]]
- $q$ is Charge of a particle
