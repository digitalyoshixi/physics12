Normal force is always a perpendicular force to the surface of the applied force.

It is **NOT** always parallel to [[Gravity]]

Force that once surface exerts on another.
[[Friction]] depends on how hard 2 surfaces push together. That's why friction is dependent on 

If something pushes up on you, the normal force with the ground is less, you feel a bit lighter.
If something pushes down on you, the normal force is more, you feel heavier.
