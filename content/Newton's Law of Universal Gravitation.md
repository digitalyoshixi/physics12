	[[Gravity]] is what attracts things together.
# Example
If we have 2 5kg objects in space, separated by 1m, they would accelerate towards each other very slowly.

If we increased their weights, they would accelerate quickly

If we moved these heavy boys farther apart, acceleration would go slower

Newton's universal law of gravitation can model this behavior.
# The Law of Universal Gravitation
$$F_{G}= \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
$G$ : [[Universal Gravitational Constant]] $6.67+E^{-11}$ 
$r$: distance between the **centers** of object 1 and 2
$m_1$ : mass of obj1
$m_2$ : mass of obj2
