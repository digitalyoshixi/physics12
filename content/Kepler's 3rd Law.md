# Fake Constant
This is a constant that is a relative constant.
It is only constant if the object being orbited around is the same.
Every object orbiting the sun will have the same Kepler's constants.
But, an object orbiting a sun and an object orbiting a random rock are going to have different Kepler's constants.
# Formula
Through empirical methods,
Kepler found that $R^3 \propto T^2$
- Where $R$ is the orbital radius
- And $T$ is the orbital period
$$K = \frac{R^3}{T^2}$$
$$K=\frac{4Ï€^2}{GM}$$
# Kepler's Constant for Heavy Orbiting Masses
If the orbiting mass is $\geq$ 20% as heavy as the orbited mass, then the Kepler's constant does not hold entirely true. The modified constant is:
$$K = \frac{G(M+m)}{4\pi^2}$$
