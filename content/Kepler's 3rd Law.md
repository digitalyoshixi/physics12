# Fake Constant
This is a constant that is a relative constant.
It is only constant if the object being orbited around is the same.
Every object orbiting the sun will have the same Kepler's constants.
But, an object orbiting a sun and an object orbiting a random rock are going to have different Kepler's constants.
# Formula
Through empirical methods,
Kepler found that $R^3 \propto T^2$
- Where $R$ is the orbital radius
- And $T$ is the orbital period
$$K = \frac{R^3}{T^2}$$
Notice that the size does not matter for Kepler's Constant
You could have a rocket ship with the same radius (it will go at the same speed regardless) and it would have 
# Alternate Formula
This can also be read as:
$$K=\frac{4Ï€^2}{GM}$$
- G is the gravitational constant
- M is the mass of the planet
