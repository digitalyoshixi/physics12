A current is a constant stream of [[Charge]] moving in the same direction. This direction is the direction of where the positive charges are going
# Formula
$$I=\frac{Q}{\triangle t}=\frac{nq}{\triangle t}$$
Where:
- Q is total [[Charge]] $nq$
### Length
$$v=\frac{L}{\triangle t}$$
$$L=v \triangle t$$
# Conventional Current
Conventional current means current flows from positive to negative.
In reality, electrons move negative to positive, but its too much work to change this in science.
