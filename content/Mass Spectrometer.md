A method to measure the mass of an ionized particle.
1. Particle is ionized
2. Particle is accelerated through [[Electrostatic Force]]
3. Mass enters a uniform [[Magnetic Field]]
4. Radius is used to calculate mass
### Formulas
In the case after exiting the electrostatic force accelerator, one can say:
$$E_{k}=E_{e}$$
So the initial velocity when entering the magnetic field is:
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}}$$
