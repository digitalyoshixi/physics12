A [[Forces|Contact Force]] that opposes the applied force.
Will differ depending on the surface the object is sliding on.
It goes down to the atomic level where atoms collide, energy for movement is lost for energy created in heat.
# $\mu$ - Coefficient Of Friction
![[Friction-20240204175954497.webp]]
Ice has a friction that is almost 0.
If a surface's friction coefficient is 0, then it would never stop.
##### Coefficient Greater Than 1
Yes, the coefficient can be greater than 1.
Its easier to pick up the object then it is to push it.
Its very rare but it occurs in cases like rubber of rubber.
### $F_s$ Static friction
[[Newton's 1st Law|Inertia]] will only be overcome if your normal force is greater than the static friction
$$F_{s}= \mu_{s}* F_{normal}$$
Static friction also applies for sliding objects. Because, acceleration is 0.
### $F_k$ Kinetic Friction
The value that the force is multiplied by when the object is in motion(passes inertia)
$$F_{k}= \mu_{k}* F_{normal}$$
