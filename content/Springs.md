A piece of metal who's properties are in a smaller space due to its twists that allows it to have more defined elastic properties.
# Spring Constant
Taken from [[Young's Modulus]]
$k = E \frac{A}{L}$
# Parallel & Series Springs

### Series Springs
Double length, same area covered.
$k=E\frac{A}{L}$
$A=A$
$L=2L$
$\therefore$
$k_{effective}=\frac{1}{2}k$
### Parallel Springs
Same length but double the area covered.
$k=E\frac{A}{L}$
$A=2A$
$L=L$
$\therefore$
$k_{effective}=2k$
