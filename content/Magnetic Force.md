# Magnetic Force
![[Magnetic Force-20240530150300910.webp]]
When 2 magnetic fields are in opposite directions, they attract eachother. The 2 objects emiting the fields will then move towards eachother
### Right Hand Rule (Interaction)
![[Magnetic Fields-20240530143449546.webp]]
Thumb in direction of [[Current]] **(WHERE THE POSITIVE CHARGES ARE GOING)**
Fingers in direction of magnetic field
Palm points in direction of magnetic force
### Formula
The magnetic force is denoted by:
$$\vec{F}_{B}=BIL\sin \theta$$
Where:
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field strength
- $\vec{I}$ is the magnitude of the current
- $L$ is the length of the wire
- $\theta$ is the angle between magnetic field direction and current direction
$$\vec{F}_{B}=qvB\sin \theta$$
##### Multiple Charges
$$\vec{F}_{B}=nqvB\sin \theta$$
### SI Unit
$Tesla(T)$  - the magnetic field strength required to exert a $1N$ force on a $1m$ wire carrying $1A$ at $90^o$ to the field

# Centripetal Charge
A charge with an initial velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field will experience UCM.
In UCM,
$F_{c}=F_{B}$
### Formulas
$$qvB=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$v=\frac{qBr}{m}$$
$$m=\frac{qB^2r^2}{2V}$$
$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$
