# Elastic
![[Elastics-20240405204120872.webp|432]]
A special material that is able to return to its original shape when the influencing force is removed
### Properties of Elastic Systems
##### Damping
A higher damping more energy is lost quicker.
If damping is 0, no energy is lost ever.
##### Spring constant (k)
This is the stiffness of the spring.
It is very tricky to calculate the spring constant. Even the tiniest imperfection will change 'k'.
Springs are not designed with a specific 'k' in mind because it is virtually impossible to manufacture your exact 'k' spring.
###### SI Units
The SI unit for the spring constant is $N/m$
##### Elasticity

# Hooke's Law
An empirical law which states that the deformation (x) of an elastic object is [[Direct Relationship|Directly Proportional]] to the applied force ($F_{a}$)
$$F_{a}=kx$$
$$\overrightarrow a = \frac{kx}{m}$$
This simply means that more force will deform the object more. And no force, means no deformities
### Deformation And Energy
When an elastic is it **stores energy** and can **release it** when no force is applied.
Maximum deformation is the same regardless of if you compress or expand the elastic

# Elastic Potential Energy
$$E_{e}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
k : the spring constant
x : length of the deformation
### Elastic Potential Energy Proof
- [[Elastic Potential Energy Proof]]
### Why Strings Bounce
- Force of gravity higher than elastic force.
- Eventually it reaches an equilibrium force
- It slows down
- The force upwards makes it go upwards
- Eventually it bounces too high
- Gravity pulls it back down
And the cycle repeats. Its a back and forth of elastic and gravitational energy

# Elasticity Coefficient (From Gizmo Lab)
If elasticity = 0, then 2 colliding objects have the same final velocity
If elasticity < 1, then some energy is lost due to heat or sound.
If elasticity = 1, then no energy is lost
