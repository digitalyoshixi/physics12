# Law of Charges
1. Like charges repel 
2. Opposite charges attract
3. Charged objects attract some neutral objects
# Elementary Charge $e=1.602*10^{-19}$
The coulombs in the smallest amount of charge.
It was discovered during the [[Millikan Oil Drop Experiment]].
# Formula
$$q=Ne$$
Where:
- $q$ is charge
- $N$ is number of elementary charges or excess charges
- $e$ is elementary charge value
