# Magnetic Force
![[Magnetic Force-20240530150300910.webp]]
When 2 magnetic fields are in opposite directions, they attract eachother. The 2 objects emiting the fields will then move towards eachother
### Right Hand Rule (Interaction)
![[Magnetic Fields-20240530143449546.webp]]
Thumb in direction of current(This can vary)
Fingers in direction of magnetic field
Palm points in direction of magnetic force
### Formula
The magnetic force is denoted by:
$$\vec{F}_{Magnetic}=BIL\sin \theta$$
Where:
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field strength
- $\vec{I}$ is the magnitude of the current
- $L$ is the length of the wire
- $\theta$ is the angle between the 2 magnetic fields
### SI Unit
$Tesla(T)$  - the magnetic field strength required to exert a $1N$ force on a $1m$ wire carrying $1A$ at $90^o$ to the field
