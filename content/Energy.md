Energy is the ability to change
# Energy Efficiency
### Heat Loss
A lot of energy is lost to heat. For the most part you can't heat for anything practical.
### Energy Density
Batteries do not store a lot of energy for their volume
# Conservation of Energy
When an object hits the ground, the kinetic energy is high, but the gravitational potential energy is 0.
This is caused because of the conservation of energy.
# Non-Conservation of Energy
They say energy cannot be created nor destroyed.
That is true for the entire universe, but if you define your system as a smaller part of the universe. For example, a cup is your system.
If I applied work on the system, then energy of the system would be increased.
$E_{t_{1}}+W=E_{t_{2}}$
