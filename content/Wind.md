# $_{a}v_{g}$
Wind is the air velocity relative to/above the ground
You **don't** care about where the wind is coming from. You **DO CARE** about where the wind is **HEADED** because you can form a vector from that

Oftentimes, the vector of the plane is not parallel to the wind vector.
In these cases, you can find the [[Resultant Vector]] though vector addition with the [[2D Vector Components]]
