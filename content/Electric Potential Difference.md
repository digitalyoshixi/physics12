# $\triangle V$
The difference of energy at different positions
# Formulas
$$\triangle V = V_{2}-V_{1}$$
$$\triangle V = E \triangle d$$
Where:
- $E$ is [[Electric Fields|Electric Field Intensity]]
# Batteries
- Car batteries have high voltage, low current.
- 1000 9V batteries have a lot of voltage, but very low current unless you connect them in series, then the current will be enough to kill you
