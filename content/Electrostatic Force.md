Force that attracts or repels 2 particles.
This is also the force responsible for chemical bonds, link atoms and molecules
# Formula
### 2 Particle
$$F_{e}=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{\triangle d^2}$$
where k is [[Coulomb|Coulomb's Constant]]
$q_{1}$ is the charge of a electron
$q_{2}$ is the charge of the other electron
$d$ is the distance between electrons
### Within Field
$F_{e}=qE$
where:
- $E$ is the [[Electric Fields|Field Intensity]]
