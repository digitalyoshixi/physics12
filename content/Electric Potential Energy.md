Potential energy of all electronics
### Reference Point
Reference point depends on the polarity of the charge. 
For attracting charges, reference point is at $-\infty$
For a repulsing charge, reference point is at $\infty$
# Formula
### 1 Charge
$$E_{e}=qE(\triangle d)$$
### 2 Charges
##### Attraction
$$E_{e}=-\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{\triangle d}$$
##### Repulsion
$$E_{e}=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{\triangle d}$$
##### Provided Electric Potential
$$E_{e}=qV$$
- $V$ is [[Electric Potential]]
$$W=q(\triangle V)$$
- $\triangle V$ is [[Electric Potential Difference|Voltage]]
