Potential energy of all electronics
### Reference Point
Reference point depends on the polarity of the charge. 
For attracting charges, reference point is at $-\infty$
For a repulsing charge, reference point is at $\infty$
# Formula
##### Attraction
$$E_{e}=-\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{\triangle d}$$
##### Repulsion
$$E_{e}=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{\triangle d}$$
