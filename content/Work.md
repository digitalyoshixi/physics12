# Work
Energy is the ability to change. Work is the vector in the **same** direction as displacement.
### Formula
$$W = \triangle E$$
$$W = F(\triangle d)\cos \theta$$
### SI Units
$J$ Joules
$Nm$ Newton meter
# Energy Efficiency
### Heat Loss
A lot of energy is lost to heat. For the most part you can't heat for anything practical.
### Energy Density
Batteries do not store a lot of energy for their volume
### No Work
May occur in cases where things are not moving. i.e you are holding something
### Positive Work
Transferring energy to the object
### Negative Work
Taking energy out of an object
- Losing tug of war
- Getting hit by a car
The direction the object travels does not equate to the force you provide

# Conservation of Energy
When an object hits the ground, the kinetic energy is high, but the gravitational potential energy is 0.
This is caused because of the conservation of energy.
