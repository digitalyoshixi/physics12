# Elastic Collision
Highly theoretical. Most objects are only partly elastic
These are collisions that do not lose any energy from heat, sound, etc.

$$v_{1}^{'}=(\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})(v_{1})+(\frac{2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})(v_{2})$$
$$v_{2}^{'}=(\frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})(v_{1})+(\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}})(v_{2})$$

$$v_{1}^{'}=(\frac{1}{m_{1}+m_{2}})((m_{1}-m_{2})(v_{1})+(2m_{2})(v_{2}))$$
$$v_{2}^{'} = (\frac{1}{m_{1}+m_{2}})((2m_{1})(v_{1})+(m_{2}-m_{1})(v_{2}))$$
# Maximum Compression/ Minimum Separation
Relative to each other, the 2 masses are at rest. This means the 2 masses are moving at the same velocity.
