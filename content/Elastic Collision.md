# Elastic Collision
Highly theoretical.
These are collisions that do not lose any energy from heat, sound, etc.
You will use:
1. [[Linear Momentum|Conservation of Momentum]]
2. [[Kinetic Energy|Conservation of Kinetic Energy]]
# Inelastic Collisions
- When you deform a paper, the shape changes as the energy is dissipated into heat.
- Rocks don't break, very little energy is lost from the collision. Hard objects hitting each other should not deform. You're also not losing kinetic energy
