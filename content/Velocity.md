It is a [[Quantitative Data Types|Vector]] quantity.

You can find several types of velocity:
### Instantaneous Velocity $\overrightarrow v_i$
Instant velocity at a given time
Use [[Calculus IROC]]
### Average Velocity $\overrightarrow v_{avg}$
Average velocity between 2 points in time.

# SI unit
$m/s$
