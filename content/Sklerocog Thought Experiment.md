You are given a box with a certain amount of sklerocog. You dont know how many are in there. You can find the mass of the box.
You need to find the mass of one sklerocog.
There is no method to find it theoretically, it must be done empirically.
Ask for infinite boxes, then find the smallest difference between 2 box masses.
You have a high confidence that the mass of one would be that smallest difference
