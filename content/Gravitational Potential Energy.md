# Gravitational Potential Energy
The energy to counteract gravity
$$E_{g} = mg(\triangle h)$$
# Real Gravitational Potential Energy
Reference point $E_{g}=0$ as $r_{1}\to \infty$ since that is where $F_G$ = 0
### Gravitational Force
$$F_{G}= \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
$r :$ radius of the object
$M :$ mass of object being orbitted
$m :$ mass of object orbitting
$G:$ [[Universal Gravitational Constant]]
### Gravitational Potential Energy
$$E_{G} = -\frac{GMm}{r}$$

It is negative because infinity is reference point. Everytime you raise something up, the distance from infinity get smaller
