# Gravitational Potential Energy
The energy to counteract gravity
$$E_{g} = mg(\triangle h)$$
# Real Gravitational Potential Energy
Reference point $E_{g}=0$ as $r_{1}\to \infty$ since that is where $F_G$ = 0
$$F_{G}= \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
$$W = \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r_{1}}$$
$$E_{G}=-W$$
This is because infinity is reference point. Everytime you raise something up, you get closer to infinity
$$E_{G}=-\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r_{1}}$$
where $r_{1}$ is the radius of the object
